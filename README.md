Overview
===

This project is my own intellectual work to develop a game using python pygame. I hope you enjoy it!

Modules
---

* **BattleBoats.py** - The main executable for this project  
* **resources**      - contains music and images used in the game  
* **components**     - contains all running code.

Module requirements
---

Pygame and Python 3 is necessary to run. *Setup.sh* will install pygame once python is installed.

*Note: Currently there is a problem if 2 versions of python are installed.
If this is the case, BattleBoats.py needs to be run using python3*

Python3 needs to be installed into your System Path, or an interpreter needs to be set for BattleBoats.py
to understand how to execute.

Looking to the future
===

This game is currently in prealpha and I have aspirations to make improvements.  
Such improvements that are scheduled to be implemented can be located in Notes.  

Thanks and hope you enjoy!

Known Bugs
---

There is currently a known bug where the game will not play on computers that have no way of scaling 1080p.
This is in the process of being fixed.
